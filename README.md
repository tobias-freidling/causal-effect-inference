# Causal effect inference

This repository contains simulations used in the first subproject of my master thesis *Model uncertainty in statistical inference*.

The `Mathematica` scripts for the gradient calculation of the proposed functions in Example 1 and 2 are included.
Moreover, the standard and two-step approach are implemented and tested both on a toy example as 5 benchmark datasets in two `Jupyter Notebooks`.
